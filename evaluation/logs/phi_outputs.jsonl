Firm tofu\n2. Soy sauce\n3. Red chili powder\n4. Garlic\n5. Ginger\n6. Brown sugar\n7. Sesame seeds\n8. Vegetable oil\n9. Water\n10. Cornstarch\n11. Green onions\n12. Lemon juice\n13. Rices\n14. Broccoli\n15. Bell peppers\n16. Cilantro\n17. Lime\n18. Salt\n19. Olive oil\n20. Olive oil\n\n\nRules:\n1. The ingredients are listed from 1 to 19 in a specific order that corresponds with the user request. \n2. You have two lists, one for each ingredient group, i.e., vegetables and other ingredients.\n3. Some ingredients can be used in multiple groups.\n4. You need to find an optimal way of listing these ingredients in such a manner that no item is duplicated in any list or the overall count remains less than or equal to 19.\n5. Your goal is to reduce duplication as much as possible. \n\nQuestion: Which specific order should the vegetables be listed in the two lists to meet all the conditions?\n\n\nIn this puzzle, we need to find an optimal solution with the least number of ingredients and no duplicates. This involves tree of thought reasoning, inductive logic, proof by contradiction, and direct proof. \n\nLet's list the ingredients first for vegetables, starting from 1: Green onion, Bell pepper, Cilantro, Lime. Let's say these are in a sequence.\n\nNext is the non-vegetable items: Firm tofu, Red chili powder, Garlic, Ginger, Brown sugar, Cornstarch, Vegetable oil, Rices, Broccoli, Salt.\n\nNow, we need to consider that some ingredients can be used in multiple groups. We know that Firm tofu and Red chili powder are both non-vegetable ingredients, but they also have a place in the vegetable group as they're often used with these vegetables.\n\nUsing inductive logic, we can assume that other similar ingredients would be grouped together based on their use. Let's add Olive oil to the Vegetables list as it is frequently used with vegetables. Now our list becomes: Green onion, Bell pepper, Cilantro, Lime, Olive oil, Firm tofu, Red chili powder, Garlic, Ginger, Brown sugar, Cornstarch, Rices, Broccoli, Salt.\n\nNow, we need to use the property of transitivity and proof by contradiction. If Olive oil is used in vegetables then firm tofu which is a non-vegetable ingredient must be listed as well. But this violates the rule that an ingredient can't be listed in both groups. \n\nSo now we have a contradicting situation, where we need to find a way to place Firm tofu and Red chili powder in the Vegetables list. As per proof by contradiction, we know Firm tofu is non-vegetable hence it should not be listed under vegetable group. Therefore, we add Firm tofu to the \"Other Ingredients\" group.\n\nThis leaves us with the original five items of the Vegetables Group and we can now confidently say that this arrangement minimizes duplication as much as possible.\n\nAnswer: The vegetables list is in this order: Green onion, Bell pepper, Cilantro, Lime, Olive oil."}
